## TCP CC<br>
In this Ex I write two program files: Sender.c and Receiver.c. The Sender sending a file and the
Receiver receive it and measure the time it took for his program to receive the file.
The file sent in two parts (first half and second half [Each half is 50% of the file]) each
half sent according to one of the CC algorithms- Cubic or Renu.
I run the program with a packet lost tool in the following levels:
0% lost, 10% lost, 15% lost, 20% lost.
